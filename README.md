# Perl scripts for PAN-OS API - Monitor
Some perl scripts to get informations from a PaloAlto Network appliance.

I used them to get informations into my cacti in my company.

I hope they will be useful.

Be careful, in some scripts, I don't handle with exceptions. I will correct that in future commits.

# /!\WARNING/!\

In the GetSeverity script, i had to create a scheduled report on the PAN appliance, that gives us all the informations we need.
